# Week 1

## Overview

This project is a simple REST API service built using **Golang**.
It implements basic CRUD functionality using **in-memory storage (Go map)** without any external database.

This was implemented as part of Week 1 assignment to understand:
- HTTP server in Go
- REST APIs
- JSON handling
- In-memory storage
- Concurrency handling

---

## Features

- Create User (POST)
- Get All Users (GET)
- In-memory data storage
- Thread-safe operations using Mutex
- JSON request and response handling

---

## Tech Stack

- Golang
- net/http
- encoding/json
- sync (Mutex)

# Week 2 

## Overview
This project is a backend REST API built using Go.
In Week 2, the application was upgraded from in-memory storage to a PostgreSQL relational database using Bun ORM, along with automated testing and Docker support.

## Enhancements
PostgreSQL integration
Bun ORM implementation
Auto table migration
RESTful CRUD endpoints
Endpoint test cases
Dockerization using Docker & Docker Compose

## Tech Stack
Language: Go
Database: PostgreSQL
ORM: Bun
Testing: Go testing package
Containerization: Docker & Docker Compose
